# Fluorescence Imitating Brightfield Imaging (FIBI) For Functional Tissue Units

## June 15, 2025

Fluorescence Imitating Brightfield Imaging (FIBI) \[1\] is a microscopy technique developed at UC Davis by Dr. Farzad Fereidouni with guidance from Dr. Richard Levenson. This technology represents a form of “slide-free microscopy," enabling much faster imaging of tissue specimens at the histological level compared to traditional slide methods, which necessitate extensive processing (such as formalin fixation, paraffin embedding, and thin sectioning). Thick or unsectioned specimens, whether fresh or fixed, can be prepared and scanned in just minutes.  Resulting images reveal the three-dimensional structure of meso-scale anatomical structures (see **Fig. 1**), using a method involving image acquisitions at multiple focal planes..

# Functional Tissue Units

Functional tissue units (see **Fig. 2**) form the basic building blocks of organs and are important for understanding and modeling the healthy physiological function of the organ and changes that occur during disease states \[2\].

# FIBI for Functional Tissue Units

FIBI-processed images (see **Fig. 3, right**) make it possible to study whole FTUs by providing rapid, high-resolution visualization of intact tissue architecture without the need for traditional sectioning. The 2.5-dimensional nature of these images preserves spatial continuity and depth cues, enabling a clearer interpretation of FTU structure and physiological function plus meso-scale tissue organization.

# Images

All specimens (except prostate and liver) were imaged using the FIBI microscopy method detailed in \[1\]. Although FIBI was designed for fresh/wet tissue imaging, specimens were sent to the imaging lab as FFPE blocks due to the logistical challenges associated with shipping wet tissues. Upon arrival, paraffin was eliminated from the blocks using xylenes, various grades of ethanol, and water. Rehydrated tissues were stained briefly with hematoxylin (15 seconds) and eosin (30 seconds) before being scanned with FIBI. An extended depth of focus (EDOF) system was used during the scanning process to facilitate in-focus capture of irregular surfaces spanning multiple focal planes. For multi-field scans, individual fields of view were flatfield-corrected and stitched together using a stitching algorithm developed by Microvisioneer.

The prostate FTU (glandular acinus) was captured over a series of focal planes to generate an image stack that can be navigated by the viewer for a more interactive experience. Tissue preparation methods were the same as described above.

The liver FTU (liver lobule) was captured from a specimen that was never embedded in paraffin, though staining and imaging were otherwise equivalent to the remaining specimens.

Following acquisition, all images were visually enhanced in GIMP as needed, including processes such as artifact removal, color correction, enhancement of brightness/contrast, and sharpening.
